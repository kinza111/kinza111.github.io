I am a Graduate Student Researcher at [UCR](https://www.ucr.edu). Being a Bioinformatics major amd computational biologist, my research has been diverse, but my long-term goal has always been to understand evolutionary and adaptive mechanisms in plants. I have developed and applied bioinformatics tools to identify and analyze gene family members involved in stress responses. My recent work is focused on plant genetics, where I combine evolutionary theory with [century-scale experiments in barley](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl0038) to investigate how genetically diverse composite crosses have adapted to California's environment over time.
